# cardiovascular-and-respiratory-model
This repository contains a model of the cardiovascular and respiratory system, which is used to simulate various physiological parameters. It is intially used to evaluate an implemented classification, proposed in the article "Algorithmic distinction of ARDS and Heart Failure in ICU data from medical embedded systems by using a computer model" [1].

The model is implemented using MATLAB/Simulink and is based on existing models from literature. The cardiovascular system is based on preceding works by Batzel et al. [2]. The respiratory system was initially presented by Tehrani et al. [3].
